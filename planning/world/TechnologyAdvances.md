## Conclusion: The Technological Horizon

The five years since the Great Plains War have witnessed remarkable technological advancement, fundamentally altering the relationship between individual property owners and organized power structures. Defensive capabilities once exclusive to nation-states now reside in private hands. Communication networks operate beyond governmental control. Surveillance has transformed from a one-way activity into a contested domain.

These developments have created a precarious balance—defensive technologies have advanced sufficiently to make external invasion prohibitively costly, but this very capability creates perception of threat that may motivate pre-emptive action. The ungoverned territories find themselves in a classic security dilemma, where measures taken to increase safety may ultimately reduce it by provoking response.

The Armadillo Alliance's emerging drone network represents the next frontier in this technological evolution. By networking individual defensive capabilities into a coordinated system, the Alliance could create a defensive umbrella covering the entire ungoverned region. Such a system would virtually eliminate the possibility of successful invasion—but might also appear indistinguishable from an offensive capability to external observers.

This technological trajectory raises the fundamental question at the heart of the post-war era: Can a society truly protect itself without becoming what it opposes? The answer may determine not just the future of the ungoverned lands, but the very possibility of freedom in a world of competing power structures.
