# Main Plot: The Armadillo Alliance

## Core Conflict Overview

Five years after the Great Plains War, the ungoverned territories face a new kind of threat. While the direct military invasion by the Republic of New Mexico has been repelled, more subtle dangers have emerged. Nation-states, corporate interests, and internal factions all present challenges to the continued independence of the ungoverned lands. At the center of this evolving conflict stands Kiki van Steen, whose efforts to organize disparate armadillos into a cohesive defensive network will determine whether freedom can survive in a world of competing power structures.

## Act Structure

### Act One: Network Formation

#### Inciting Incident
Intelligence reports reveal that multiple nation-states are developing new capabilities specifically designed to counter individual armadillo defenses. These developments suggest preparation for a coordinated approach that could overcome the defensive advantages demonstrated during the Great Plains War.

- Jake Schwartz expresses concerns about centralization while acknowledging the threat
- Initial testing of prototype systems reveals promising results but significant implementation challenges
- Elena Vasquez, a deep-cover New Mexican agent, positions herself to gain access to the developing network
- Richardson Industries, through representative Marcus Chen, offers resources to accelerate development with concerning strings attached

#### First Plot Point
During a demonstration of the prototype drone network, the system successfully detects and neutralizes what appears to be a probing incursion at the border. This proof of concept galvanizes support for the project while raising the stakes, as external powers now have evidence of the emerging capability.

### Act Two-A: Implementation Challenges

#### Complications
- Technical obstacles emerge in scaling the prototype to cover larger territories
- Philosophical divisions arise among armadillos about appropriate levels of coordination
- Resource limitations force difficult decisions about which areas receive protection first
- Security concerns grow as the network becomes a high-value intelligence target
- Wil Brierson raises jurisdictional questions about the relationship between the network and police services

#### Midpoint Reversal
A partial network deployment successfully prevents a covert operation against a key Alliance facility, but post-incident analysis reveals that the attackers had detailed knowledge of the system's capabilities and limitations. This suggests a security breach within the Alliance itself, transforming the external threat into an internal hunt for infiltration.

### Act Two-B: Trust and Betrayal

#### Escalating Complications
- Security protocols disrupt normal operations and create friction between Alliance members
- Suspicion falls on various individuals, including some of Kiki's trusted associates
- Elena Vasquez uses the atmosphere of distrust to further her intelligence gathering while deflecting attention
- Jake Schwartz's public criticism of increased security measures creates tension with Kiki
- Richardson Industries leverages the crisis to push for greater corporate involvement in network management

#### Second Plot Point
Kiki discovers evidence pointing to Elena Vasquez's true identity, but before she can act on this information, Vasquez triggers a prepared contingency plan that temporarily disables critical Alliance communication systems. With the Alliance partially blinded, border sensors detect unusual activity suggesting imminent coordinated action against multiple locations.

### Act Three: Resolution

#### Final Confrontation
- Kiki must rely on the incomplete drone network and traditional armadillo methods to respond to the emerging threat
- Jake Schwartz mobilizes traditional armadillos to fill gaps in the compromised network
- Wil Brierson coordinates police services to support defensive efforts despite jurisdictional ambiguity
- Elena Vasquez faces a critical decision about whether to complete her mission or act on her evolved understanding of the ungoverned territories
- The distributed nature of the Alliance is tested against a sophisticated attack designed to exploit centralized vulnerabilities

#### Resolution
The combined response successfully defends against the attack, demonstrating that the integration of networked technology with traditional armadillo principles creates a more resilient system than either approach alone.
