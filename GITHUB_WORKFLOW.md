# GitHub Workflow for Ungoverned: Armadillo Arms Race

## Overview

This document outlines the workflow for managing all files and development tasks for "Ungoverned: Armadillo Arms Race" exclusively through GitHub. This approach ensures proper version control, collaboration capabilities, and maintains a single source of truth for all project assets.

## Core Principles

1. **GitHub-Exclusive Management**: All files must be created, edited, and managed directly through the GitHub repository
2. **No Local File Creation**: Avoid creating local files outside of the repository structure
3. **Consistent Commit Messages**: Use standardized commit message format for clear change tracking
4. **Regular Commits**: Commit changes frequently to maintain granular version history
5. **Structured Organization**: Maintain the established directory structure for all new files

## Directory Structure

└── resources/               # Additional resources
```

## Commit Message Format

All commit messages should follow this standardized format:

```
[CATEGORY] Brief description of changes

Detailed explanation if necessary
```

Categories include:
- `[WORLD]` - World-building files
- `[CHAR]` - Character development files
- `[PLOT]` - Plot structure and narrative files
- `[TECH]` - Technology speculation files
- `[DRAFT]` - Chapter drafts
- `[DOCS]` - Documentation updates
- `[STRUCT]` - Repository structure changes

## Workflow Process

### 1. File Creation

When creating new files:
- Create files directly in the appropriate directory within the repository
- Use descriptive filenames following established conventions
- Include proper Markdown formatting and structure
- Commit new files with appropriate commit messages

### 2. File Editing

When editing existing files:
- Make changes directly to the files in the repository
- Ensure changes maintain consistent formatting and structure
- Commit edits with clear descriptions of changes made

### 3. Progress Tracking

- Update TASKS.md to reflect completed tasks
- Update PROGRESS.md for significant project milestones
- Use commit messages to document progress

### 4. Version Control

- Create meaningful commits that encapsulate related changes
- Use commit messages to explain the purpose of changes
- Maintain a clean commit history that tells the story of development

### 5. Collaboration

- Use GitHub's built-in features for collaboration
- Maintain clear documentation to facilitate understanding
- Ensure all project participants follow this workflow

## Best Practices

1. **Commit Frequency**: Make commits at logical breakpoints rather than arbitrary intervals
2. **Commit Scope**: Each commit should represent a coherent set of related changes
3. **Documentation**: Keep workflow documentation updated as processes evolve
4. **File Organization**: Maintain consistent organization within the established structure
5. **Backup Awareness**: While GitHub provides version control, be mindful of having appropriate backups

## Implementation

This workflow is effective immediately for all further development of "Ungoverned: Armadillo Arms Race" and applies to all aspects of the project including:

- World-building documentation
- Character development
- Plot structure and narrative planning
- Technology speculation
- Chapter drafting
- Revision and editing
- Final manuscript preparation

By following this GitHub-exclusive workflow, we ensure consistent version control, clear progress tracking, and maintain a single source of truth for all project assets.
